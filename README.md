# stepup-unity

## Elevator pitch

Have you ever felt a strong urge to control the movement of a digital representation of a ball rolling on a digital plane floating in mid air with your phone?
__Now you have the chance!__

In this stepup we will get a glipse of the possibilities that the Unity game engine has to offer software developers with limited game development experience.

We will cover the absolute basics of Unity, and together build a small game that is playable on a device _(preferably a smartphone or laptop)_ of your choice.

## Preparation

If you would like to get your hands dirty trying out some of the features on your own laptop, and in order to get a swift start of the Step Up, we would like you to do the following preparations.

* Clone this repository
* Download Unity _(personal edition will do just fine)_ and create a Unity account _(this is done in the app)_.
* Set the layout _(see the menu in the top right corner)_ to 2 by 3 and move the Project window below Hierarchy [(like this)](http://answers.unity3d.com/storage/temp/6106-unity.jpg)

If you want to setup your development environment for testing on mobile devices _(‚òùüèª optional)_ you also need to:

* Download the preffered SDK
* Download the Unity Remote application on your device
